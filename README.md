# About ^_^

Hi there! This is a repo for my discord bot that I've graciously named after the one and only <br>
Ashen witch from the anime "Majo no tabitabi", Elaina! <br>
<br>

# Features

- [x] Add public mod log support
- [x] Add kick/ban support with reasoning that sends to said mod log
- [x] Support for better embed links (like for twitter, pixiv, etc)
- [X] Add ability to import emotes from 7tv to discord server
- [x] Add ability to live reload cogs
- [X] Custom roles support for stuff (probably gonna do modals for this)
- [X] XKCD sender
- [ ] Quick mod actions
- [ ] Add DB support (I'm tired of having to hardcode discord channel and server IDs lol)
- [ ] Add some kind of "suspicious user" alert potentially
- [ ] Add filter for stuff (I'm gonna hate doing regex for this)
- [ ] Birthday stuff (maybe?)
- [ ] Send in a chat when I go live
- [ ] Download and send in chat audio from a youtube video
- [ ] ADD STICKER ADDITIONS TO DISCORD SERVERS (FUCK DISCORD FOR STILL NOT HAVING THIS ON MOBILE)


# TODO
- [X] Add a function for getting and parsing json data from 7tv.io
- [X] Check if the emote list is bigger than the available emote space on the discord server
- [X] Add a function to download all emotes from the list (maybe can also make this a separate command on it's own)
- [X] Upload converted emotes to discord server
- [ ] Probably a good idea to add a ratelimit of some sort so that we don't get ratelimited when adding a bunch of emotes at once
- [ ] Convert emotes if their size is too big
